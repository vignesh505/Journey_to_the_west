        <p>Sun Wukong, also known as the Great Sage Equal of Heaven, was born from a magical rock. He eventually became the king of a group of monkeys and acquired the powerful Ruyi Jingu Bang weapon. After rebelling against heaven, he was imprisoned for 500 years before joining Tang Sanzang on his journey to retrieve Buddhist sutras. In the end, he was granted the title of Victorious Fighting Buddha.</p>
