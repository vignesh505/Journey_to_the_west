        <p>Zhu Bajie, also known as Pigsy, was once an immortal commander of 100,000 troops in the Milky Way. However, he was banished to Earth for harassing the moon goddess, Chang'e. Pigsy is known for his laziness, gluttony, and jealousy of Sun Wukong. Despite his flaws, he plays a crucial role in aiding Tang Sanzang on his journey. In the end, he is granted the title of "Cleaner of the Altars" due to his low spirituality.</p>
